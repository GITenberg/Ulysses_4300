<h2>Preface</h2>

<p>For many of us, James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em> is the most richly satisfying novel ever written. Like Shakespeare’s best plays, it can be read again and again, each time with increasing understanding and pleasure and with never a hint of exhausting the text’s possibilities. But anyone’s initial journey through this bottomless book will inevitably be difficult. Dozens of unfamiliar allusions teem on every page, implying highly detailed, complex commentary on the action. Puzzles and enigmas lurk everywhere, asking readers to become detectives, weigh evidence, track down leads. The past inheres in the present through characters’ individual memories and also through collective memories of shared history. Places remember events, and journeys through Dublin reflect characters’ states of mind, making even the urban landscape a text to read. Distinctive motifs connect widely separated passages, forcing one to jump around laterally and not read only in the linear, goal-oriented way of most novels. New kinds of narrative presentation emerge from chapter to chapter, changing the rules of the game whenever one begins to feel too comfortable. And even with help from people who know the book well and can communicate its mysteries effectively, there is only so much complexity that one can take in on a first pass. Until all the book’s strange pieces find their places in the warehouse of memory—until it can be held in mind as a totality—too much information can only be an annoyance hindering one’s passage from sentence to sentence. After that threshold is crossed, more is suddenly better.</p>

<p>The notes that I have been writing for <em>The Joyce Project</em> for about ten years attempt to address these challenges, not least the gulf separating first-time and experienced readers. Newcomers to the novel want the bare minimum necessary for making some kind (any kind!) of initial sense of a passage. Veterans want anything but that. My solution has been to write notes that go on for as long as needed but begin with a stripped-down introductory paragraph: one that conveys the most essential contextual information and some succinct suggestion of how to use it. Readers who click on a “Read More” button can explore allusions in more detail, look more closely at how they can shape readings of the text, consider alternative interpretations, attend to what various scholars have written, make connections to other passages in the novel, and so forth. On the principle that conceptual learning is hugely facilitated by visual and aural illustration, the website also pairs notes with various kinds of still images and videos: period photographs, maps, art works, recordings of musical performances, and the like.</p>

<p>Sahas Subramanian has generated this epub edition from the Gutenberg text of <em>Ulysses</em> and <em>The Joyce Project</em>. Instead of the colored hyperlinks found on the website (each representing a content category), his edition employs the numbered sequences of traditional footnotes or endnotes. And instead of notes composed of multiple paragraphs, with a “Read More” button after the first one, his epub presents only the opening paragraph, with an option to “Go to <a href="http://joyceproject.com/">joyceproject.com</a>” to read more. My work on the website is far from completed, so the epub edition too is a work in progress. Subramanian’s software will keep it updated as notes are added to the website or revised. </p>

<p>It may be helpful to learn a few things here about the website and the epub edition, though all them should become apparent to readers sooner or later. In decreasing levels of obviousness, they are:</p>

<p>1) Many notes on the website, probably most of them, are linked to more than one passage of text, whether within a chapter or in multiple chapters. This practice differs from the pop-up notes embedded in the epub text, which follow the traditional numbering practice of footnotes or endnotes. Different note numbers within an epub chapter may take you to the same note, which does not happen in printed texts.</p>

<p>2) A link at the bottom of each note will take you to the corresponding note on the website, where you can choose to “Read More.” Avoiding these links will spare you the curse of too much information, but it will also deprive you of visual and aural illustrations, and readers will need to work out a balance between reading just one paragraph and digging deeper. This need to find a balance between too much and too little information afflicts all first-time readers of <em>Ulysses</em>, no matter what reference works they may be using. Avoid annotation altogether and most of the book flies right over your head. Dig into it too deeply and you lose the absorbing flow of reading a novel. You will need to find your own best practice.</p>

<p>3) For anyone who wishes to consult my notes in conjunction with a printed text, the website offers a way to divide its continuous electronic text according to the pagination of five commonly sold print books. Lineation is not reproduced, and readers will also discover that Joyce’s text is not exactly identical from edition to edition. In fact, there are literally thousands of textual variants. The text that you are reading on my website or in the epub edition is my own evolving approximation of an ideal text, different in many particulars from the Gutenberg text and from all printed copies. Some notes address these editorial issues, typically long after the “Read More” button.</p>

<p>4) Since its guiding principle is to give users as much information as they can handle, some of the website’s notes contain “spoilers.” Some annotators believe that notes should not give away, say, the surprise hidden near the end of <em>Lotus Eaters</em>, when, after lending his newspaper to Bantam Lyons, Bloom says “I was just going to throw it away,” and Lyons responds, “I’ll risk it.” Explaining what is happening here, they contend, deprives readers of the challenge and pleasure of discovering it on their own much later in the novel. I resist this view, for several reasons: <em>Ulysses</em> is not the kind of book that can be ruined by knowing what happens; first-time readers need all the help they can get; and withholding assistance perpetuates the privilege of those “in the know,” essentially taunting newcomers to prove their worth by treading the same hard ground their betters have. In my opinion, life is too short and the book too difficult for such an attitude. Nevertheless, when some disclosure could spoil a reader’s process of discovery I try to keep it out of a note’s opening paragraph. Anyone intrepid enough to read past that point will be admitted to the club of cognoscenti without dues.</p>

<p>I first read <em>Ulysses</em> as a college student more than four decades ago. Ignorant and callow as I was, I knew nonetheless that this book would stick with me and I would return to it. I have done so often, how many times I cannot say, but enough that I no longer wish to read it in the usual sequential way. It lodges in my memory, and I return to look more closely at its countless fascinating parts in no particular order. I find, again and again, that I have not remembered something quite exactly enough: some little detail of Joyce’s choosing makes the book even better than I knew, and must be attended to. This sense of unextinguished discovery drives me to keep laboring at the work of annotation even now, as I complete my first year of retirement, and I hope it will do so for years to come. For anyone giving the daunting masterpiece a first go, wondering if it is worth all the hype, I hope that some of my notes will ease your initial passage, and that you too will find a life’s companion in this remarkable work.</p>
