<h2>Preface</h2>

<p class="preface">For many of us, James Joyce’s <i>Ulysses </i>is the most richly
satisfying novel ever written. Like Shakespeare’s plays or Homer’s
epic poems it can be read again and again, each time with increased
understanding and pleasure. It is one of those literary texts whose
possibilities never come close to being exhausted.
</p>
<p class="preface">But anyone who hopes to tackle this masterpiece for the first time
is in for a struggle. Dozens of unfamiliar allusions teem on every
page, commenting on the action in subtle, exact, and manifold ways.
Fragments of songs appear on most pages, asking to be heard as well as
understood. Puzzles and enigmas lurk everywhere, asking readers to
weigh evidence and track down leads like detectives. The past is
always seeping into the present through characters’ individual
memories and through collectively remembered history. Places remember
events, as Joyce once said, and they also become attached to the
mental states of the book’s characters, making even the city and its
environs a text to read. Distinctive phrases recur long after they
were first encountered, insisting that readers remember them, make
connections across dozens or even hundreds of pages, and learn to read
the text as a self-referential totality. People’s voices drive the
story as much as third-person narration does, and new kinds of
narration emerge from chapter to chapter, changing the rules of the
game whenever one begins to feel too comfortable.
</p>



<p class="preface">Challenges such as these impel readers to look for help outside the
text, and over the course of nearly a century many commentators have
labored to supply it, in the process learning how to better read the
novel themselves. But even with help from people who know the book
well and can communicate its mysteries effectively, there is only so
much complexity that one can take in on a first pass. Until the entire
book lodges itself in memory the way a beloved poem or opera is
lodged, until it can be held in mind the way a highly detailed but
unified map is held, too much information can only be an annoyance
hindering one’s passage from sentence to sentence. After that
threshold is crossed, more begins to be better.</p>


<p class="preface">The online notes that I have been writing for about ten years,
incorporating the work of many others and adding insights and opinions
of my own, address such challenges, not least the gulf separating
first-time and experienced readers. Newcomers to the novel want brief
nuggets that will enable them to make some (any!) sense of baffling
passages. Veterans want what comes next. The solution I have devised
is to begin each note with an introductory paragraph that conveys the
most essential contextual information and some succinct suggestion of
how to use it, and then to build “in the broadest way immarginable,”
as Joyce said in his last book. Readers who click on a “Read More”
button after the first paragraph can explore an allusion in more
detail, consider more closely how knowing it may shape the reading
process, entertain alternative interpretations, attend to what various
scholars have written, make connections to other passages in the
novel, and so on.</p>


<p class="preface">Sahas Subramanian has generated this annotated epub edition from
the Gutenberg text of <i>Ulysses</i> and from <i>The Joyce
Project</i>, incorporating only the first paragraph of each of my
notes. Instead of a “Read More” button within each note, his notes
conclude with an offer to “Read more
on <a href="http://joyceproject.com/">joyceproject.com</a>.”
As I keep adding notes to the website, and sometimes revising them,
Subramanian’s software will keep his electronic edition continually
updated. Before you look into what he has created, it may be helpful
to learn a few things here about the e-book, about the website, and
about annotation generally. All these things will eventually become
clear on their own, but some advance notice may be welcome.</p>


<p class="preface">1) Annotators of <i>Ulysses</i> must decide on a balance between
information and interpretation. Neither kind of assistance exists in a
pure state: claiming that a passage alludes to something outside the
text is itself an act of interpretation, and interpretations that are
uninformed by such considerations of context will go nowhere
fast. Commentators can emphasize one or the other, though. Some
published collections of notes try to be as objective and detached as
possible, briefly detailing things like literary references,
historical events, song lyrics, and Dublin locations while not
presuming to tell readers how to use that information. At the other
extreme, some commentators offer to act as tour guides, pointing out
some interesting and important features of a chapter and suggesting
paths for a reader to follow. My notes start with information: they
identify problematic issues and offer contexts for understanding
them. But they also explore the consequences that would follow from
accepting each context as relevant—not to perform global readings of
the entire novel, but to better appreciate some significant thread
running through Joyce’s incredibly elaborate tapestry.
</p>


<p class="preface">2) Unconstrained by length requirements, the notes on the website
can do both things in far more detail than any print commentary could
justify to a cash-strapped publisher. But the opening paragraphs
featured in the e-book try to summarize the contextual information and
its interpretive relevance as briefly as possible.</p>


<p class="preface">3) On the principle that conceptual learning is greatly facilitated
by visual and auditory learning, all the commentary on the website is
accompanied by still images and/or sound recordings and videos. Some
of these multimedia frames in the note sidebars are purely
illustrative, using photographs, works of art, and graphics to enrich
things discussed in the note and to suggest the breadth of their
cultural relevance. Others purvey more directly useful scholarly
information, giving readers access to resources like maps of Dublin
(often annotated), period photographs and film clips, newspaper
columns, advertisements, physical objects, and performances of musical
pieces mentioned in the novel. The site also has a comprehensive
alphabetical list of “People in the Novel” (there are hundreds) and a
not yet comprehensive chronological list of “Times in the Novel,”
starting with Moses and running up to (and past) the hours of June 16,
1904. Readers of the e-book will miss all of these resources unless
they make a practice of checking the website from time to time.</p>


<p class="preface">4) The website uses colored hyperlinks within the text, rather than
note numbers. The six colors represent different kinds of content
addressed within the notes, allowing readers to concentrate on ones
they are interested in as they travel through the novel. Rather than
underlining entire passages with hyperlinks, the e-book employs the
numbers of traditional footnotes and endnotes. However, Subramanian
has replicated the colors of my hyperlinks in his note numbers for the
convenience of anyone seeking out notes on the land, culture, and
history of Ireland (green), allusions to Literature (orange), the
cityscape of Dublin (brown), musical and dramatic Performances
(purple), issues pertaining to the human Body (red), or the artistic
choices of the Writer (blue). A more detailed listing of the topics
addressed in these six categories can be found on the website under
“Color Coding.”</p>


<p class="preface">5) Many notes on the website, perhaps even a majority of them, are
linked to more than one passage in the novel. This practice allows me
to join closely related passages (both within chapters and in
different chapters) and write essay-like notes that do not simply
explicate one local crux but address larger issues within the novel.
Consequently, different note numbers within the e-book may sometimes
take you to the same note. In longer notes glossing multiple passages,
you may find that your question about one of those passages is not
well answered in the opening paragraph. These would be times to go to
the website, click “Read More,” and scroll down to the paragraph that
addresses your question. To help readers find what they are looking
for in longer notes, and to save them the trouble of having to toggle
back and forth between novel and commentary, the website’s notes quote
generously from the passages being glossed and emphasize the most
relevant parts with boldfaced type. Going to the site and looking for
a boldfaced quotation of your passage can help you to quickly narrow
your search.
</p>


<p class="preface">6) For anyone who wishes to consult these notes in conjunction with
a traditional book, the website offers a way to divide its continuous
electronic text according to the pagination of five commonly sold
print editions. Lineation is not reproduced, only page numbers, but
this feature of the site can be very helpful for locating passages
within a printed text. There are many reasons why you might want to do
this, including a desire to take your own notes within the margins of
a printed text while using the e-book or the website.</p>


<p class="preface">7) The text of the novel that you read in the e-book, which is
being automatically updated to mirror the text on the website, is not
precisely identical to the Gutenberg text or to that of any print
edition. It represents my own ongoing effort to approximate an ideal
text, choosing among literally thousands of textual variations from
edition to edition of <i>Ulysses</i>—most of them very small, but some
quite consequential. Some of the website’s notes address the editorial
issues involved in these choices, usually long after the “Read More”
button.
</p>


<p class="preface">8) Avoiding the “Read More” links will spare you the curse of being
smothered by too much secondary reading, but it may also sometimes
leave you unsatisfied. People consulting the e-book’s shortened notes
will need to work out a balance between reading too little and too
much—a quandary that, far from being unique to this one collection of
annotations, bedevils all first-time readers of
<i>Ulysses</i>. Avoid published commentary altogether and most of the
book flies right over your head. Dig into it too deeply and you lose
the absorbing, enjoyable flow of reading a novel. Many coping
strategies have been suggested, such as reading a paragraph or a page
without notes, then reading the relevant notes, and then reading the
text again. You will need to find your own best practice by trial and
error.</p>


<p class="preface">9) Since my guiding principle is to give users as much information
as they can handle, my notes may contain “spoilers.” Some annotators
believe that certain surprises should be left for dedicated readers to
discover on their own, much later. I resist this view, for several
reasons: <i>Ulysses</i> is not the kind of book that can be ruined by
knowing what happens; first-time readers need all the help they can
get; and withholding assistance perpetuates the privilege of those in
the know, essentially taunting newcomers to prove their worth by
treading the same hard ground their betters have trod. Life is too
short, I think, and the book too difficult, for such an exclusionary
attitude. Nevertheless, when some disclosure could spoil the
pleasurable challenge of individual discovery I try to keep it out of
the opening paragraph. People intrepid enough to read past that point
will be admitted to the insiders’ club free of charge, except perhaps
loss of innocence.</p>


<p class="preface">Finally, a few words about my own part in all of this: The project
started with a desire<i> </i>to help my students. I envisioned a site
where all their questions could be addressed by clicking on links
rather than having to flip through multiple reference works. But as I
started writing notes I saw I could not be content with reproducing
other people’s observations. I had to write notes in my own way, and
devise a new form for doing it. Soon the project was much bigger than
I had imagined. Tracking down information on my own meant weighing
evidence more actively than when I was merely trying to relate the
fruits of someone else’s study. Joining multiple passages within notes
meant asking questions that had not always been asked before. Most
crucially, trying to explain <i>exactly</i> how some background
information might shape a reading of the novel meant that I was
constantly seeing new things in Joyce’s text. Instead of mere crutches
for a beginner limping through the book, my notes were becoming
platforms on which textual problems could be laid out in detail and
examined from many angles.</p>


<p class="preface">One published commentator has remarked that the joys
of <i>Ulysses</i> belong to the reader, and not to the annotator. Not
so for me! Each new note now feels to me like a portal of discovery,
to borrow a phrase from the novel’s ninth chapter. When I first read
this book as an ignorant but eager college student, I knew that it was
extraordinary and would draw me back. After more than four decades it
draws me back still, with no less freshness than the first time, and
with no less sense that I have much to learn. Looking carefully at
some long-familiar passage I find, again and again, that I have not
remembered something quite exactly enough, or looked quite hard enough
for analogues and implications. Some little detail of Joyce’s choosing
makes the book even more astonishingly poly-signifying than I
thought. This sense of unextinguished discovery drives me to keep
writing notes as I begin my second year of retirement, and I hope it
will do so for years to come. For anyone trying to read the daunting
masterpiece for the first time, I hope my notes will give you the
threads you need to find your way through the labyrinth, and I hope
that you too will find a life’s companion in this remarkable work.</p>
